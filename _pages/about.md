## 🌱 Introduction

Welcome to my personal academic space! I am a PhD candidate with a passion for data-driven approaches to genome mining and natural product discovery. My research sits at the exciting intersection of 🧬 computational biology, 🖥️ bioinformatics, and 🤖 machine learning, where I leverage modern tools, such as protein language models, to uncover novel bioactive compounds from microbial genomes.

## 🔬 Research Focus

My primary focus is on **natural product discovery** 🌿, a field dedicated to identifying and characterizing small molecules from living organisms that can serve as drug leads, antibiotics, or other bioactive agents. Specifically, I employ **data-driven genome mining** techniques to extract meaningful insights from microbial genomes, which are often rich but underexplored reservoirs of chemical diversity.

Additionally, I explore **protein language models (PLMs)** 📊, a rapidly advancing class of models inspired by natural language processing. These models have shown promise in predicting protein function, understanding protein-protein interactions, and identifying cryptic biosynthetic gene clusters that may encode valuable natural products. My work aims to push the boundaries of PLMs' capabilities in biological applications.

## 🛠️ Skills and Expertise

- **Bioinformatics** 🧬: Extensive experience in genome mining, sequence analysis, and annotation pipelines.
- **Machine Learning** 🤖: Application of supervised and unsupervised learning methods in biological datasets.
- **Protein Language Models** 🧠: Usage and fine-tuning of transformer-based models for protein-related predictions.
- **Natural Product Discovery** 🌿: Familiarity with biosynthetic pathways, gene cluster detection, and secondary metabolites.

## 🎓 Academic Journey

Throughout my academic journey, I have remained deeply committed to **interdisciplinary research** 🧑‍🔬. By combining biological insights with computational tools, I aim to make meaningful contributions to the discovery of new natural products that may address pressing challenges, such as **antibiotic resistance** 🦠 and **novel drug development** 💊.
