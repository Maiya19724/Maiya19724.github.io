Microbial natural products have historically been a cornerstone for the discovery of therapeutic agents. Advanced (meta)genome sequencing technologies have revealed that microbes harbor far greater biosynthetic capabilities than previously anticipated. However, despite the application of CRISPR/Cas-based gene editing and high-throughput technologies to activate silent biosynthetic gene clusters, the rapid identification of new natural products has not led to a proportional increase in the discovery rate of lead compounds or drugs. A crucial issue in this gap may be insufficient knowledge about the inherent biological and physiological functions of microbial natural products. Addressing this gap necessitates recognizing that the generation of functional natural products is deeply rooted in the interactions between the producing microbes and other (micro)organisms within their ecological contexts, an understanding that is essential for harnessing their potential therapeutic benefits. In this review, we highlight the discovery of functional microbial natural products from diverse niches, including those associated with humans, nematodes, insects, fungi, protozoa, plants, and marine animals. Many of these findings result from an organismic-interaction-guided strategy using multi-omic approaches. The current importance of this topic lies in its potential to advance drug discovery in an era marked by increasing antimicrobial resistance.
